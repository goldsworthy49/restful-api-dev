finished a good portion of the backend
really want to get rid of the "_v: 0" at the end of objects
post request for songs seems ok besides that
double check that Date.now is behaving as it should
@44:00 mark in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB9Fq9I5ocs
awaiting other requests and how the image urls will work (possible frontend?)
push changes to git when backend is solid
onto frontend tomorrow too hopefully!!!!
